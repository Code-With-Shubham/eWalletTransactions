 A digital wallet also known as "e-Wallet" is an electronic device, online service, 
or software program that allows one party to make electronic transactions with another party 
bartering digital currency units for goods and services. This can include purchasing items on-line 
with a computer or using a smartphone to purchase something at a store. Money can be 
deposited in the digital wallet prior to any transactions.
